## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Create Voice Profile
```bash
python3 cli/voicecraft.py profile create \
  --name "Louie Bernstein" \
  --samples "../aeo-optimizer-business/clients/louiebernstein/articles/*.md"
```

System analyzes:
- Sentence structure (length, fragments, questions)
- Vocabulary (words, readability, power words)
- Rhetorical devices (repetition, contrast, rule of threes)
- Emotional tone (urgency, confidence, sentiment)
- Content flow (hooks, paragraph structure)

### 2. Choose Style Influences (Optional)
```
Base: Louie Bernstein (70%)
+ Alex Hormozi (20%) - Directness, urgency
+ Seth Godin (10%) - Philosophical insight
```

### 3. Generate Content
```bash
python3 cli/voicecraft.py generate article \
  --profile "Louie Bernstein" \
  --topic "How to fix a broken sales process" \
  --influences "Alex Hormozi:0.2,Seth Godin:0.1" \
  --length 1200
```

System outputs:
- Content in your voice + influences
- Voice match score (85%+ target)
- Word count
- Metadata
