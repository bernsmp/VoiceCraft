You Think You're Learning About Funnels

Watch any Brunson webinar. You're taking notes about secret funnels, value ladders, and perfect webinar structures. You think you're learning marketing tactics.

But there's a second game running.

Invisible psychological patterns operating beneath your awareness. Brunson knows exactly what he's doing. The reason they work so well? You never notice them happening TO you.

Like a magician using misdirection while you watch the wrong hand, these patterns bypass your conscious filters. They create feelings and decisions that seem like YOUR idea.

Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them. Every sales page, every webinar, every course…

The invisible game becomes visible. You'll never consume marketing the same way again.

You Never Notice These 5 Patterns Happening TO You

Pattern #1: He Kills Your Objections Before You Form Them

Watch any Perfect Webinar. About 30-60 seconds before introducing something complex, Brunson says: "Now you're probably thinking this sounds too complicated, but..."

You hadn't thought it was complicated yet. But now when the complexity arrives, that objection is already dissolved.

He's not responding to your objections. He's preventing them from forming.

By the time your brain would naturally resist, the resistance has nowhere to land. You never feel "sold to" because your defenses never activate.

Why You Don't Notice:

Your brain thinks it's having a conversation. "He's addressing my concerns!" But he created the concern and dissolved it before you consciously formed it.

How to Spot It:

Watch for phrases like "You're probably thinking..." or "I know what you're wondering..." These appear 30-60 seconds BEFORE the content that would trigger that thought.

Use This Yourself:

Map where objections naturally form. Address them one paragraph before that point. Your audience will feel understood without knowing why.

Pattern #2: Why You Never Feel Inferior to Russell

Every Brunson story starts the same way: Past-Russell positioned as less capable than you are right now.

"I was so bad at this, I couldn't even..." "Everyone thought I was stupid..." "I failed twelve times before..."

Then: "Until I discovered this one simple thing..."

You don't consciously notice he's positioned himself below you. But your brain does. You feel superior, therefore safe. You're not reaching up to his level. You're already above where he started.

This eliminates imposter syndrome without you knowing it was there.

Why You Don't Notice:

Your ego enjoys feeling superior. The brain doesn't question feelings it likes. You feel smart and capable without realizing he made you feel that way.

How to Spot It:

Count how many times successful people start stories with failure. Often, the more successful they are, the lower they start their stories.

Use This Yourself:

Always start teaching from below your audience's current position. Make them feel advanced before showing them what's next.

Pattern #3: Your Beliefs Dissolve Without a Fight

Brunson doesn't argue with your beliefs. He collapses them using this five-step sequence:

Validates your current belief ("You're absolutely right that...")

Introduces a limitation ("But here's what most people miss...")

Shares personal cost ("I lost years figuring this out...")

Presents new belief as discovery ("Then I realized...")

Social proof ("Now thousands of people have proven...")

Your brain never defends because the attack never comes. The old belief simply... dissolves.

Why You Don't Notice:

Each step feels like agreement and expansion, not contradiction. Your guard stays down because you're being validated, not challenged.

How to Spot It:

Watch how any belief shift happens. There's always validation before disruption, personal cost before revelation.

Use This Yourself:

Never attack beliefs directly. Use this five-step sequence to dissolve and replace. The brain can't resist what it doesn't perceive as threat.

Pattern #4: You Get Permission You Didn't Know You Needed

Count how many times Brunson attributes his knowledge:

"Dan Kennedy taught me..."

"I learned this from Tony Robbins..."

"Mike Filsaime showed me..."

You think he's being humble or credible. But something else is happening in your unconscious.

If Russell learned it, you can learn it. If he can teach it, you can teach it.

The expertise becomes transferable, not special. You get permission to succeed without knowing permission was needed.

Why You Don't Notice:

Sounds like credibility-building or name-dropping. Your conscious mind categorizes it as "social proof" while your unconscious receives permission.

How to Spot It:

Successful teachers always create learning lineages. They show expertise as transferred, not originated.

Use This Yourself:

Attribute your best insights to who taught you. Creates unconscious permission for your audience to teach it too.

Pattern #5: The $2,000 Vegetable Peeler Trick

In every stack, Brunson states value before revealing what it is:

"This is worth at least $2,000 to any business..." [tells story about why] "...and it's my exact template for..."

Your brain anchors on $2,000 before knowing what "it" is. Once anchored, your brain can't effectively recalculate. The value feels real because it was established before skepticism could attach to specifics.

Why You Don't Notice:

The brain assumes logical order (explanation then value). When reversed, the conscious mind doesn't flag it as manipulation - it just accepts the anchor.

How to Spot It:

Watch any infomercial or stack. Value always comes before full revelation. "A $300 value!" before you know it's a vegetable peeler.

Use This Yourself:

State value before revealing what something is. Create the frame before filling it. The brain struggles to revalue after anchoring.

The Meta-Pattern: You're Being Pulled, Not Pushed

All five patterns create the same effect: Cognitive pull instead of push.

Preemptive dissolve →

Pulls you past objections

Status flip →

Pulls you up from below

Belief collapse →

Pulls you toward new understanding

Permission transfer →

Pulls you into action

Value anchor →

Pulls you toward acceptance

You never feel "sold to" because you're not being pushed. You're being systematically pulled forward by invisible vacuums Brunson creates.

You lean in, not back. You feel curious, not resistant. The decision feels like yours because the pull is invisible.

These Patterns Are Everywhere (You Just Never Named Them)

Every MasterClass trailer: "My first soufflé? Absolute disaster." - Gordon Ramsay

Every LinkedIn viral post: "I got fired yesterday..." [three paragraphs later] "...best thing that happened to me."

Every course launch: "This changed my student's life..." before explaining what "this" is.

Now you can't unsee them. Your boss starting meetings with "I don't have all the answers..." That friend who always says who taught them something before giving advice.

Once you see the patterns, you see the game within the game.

But Enough About Brunson - He's Already Made His Millions

The real discovery isn't his patterns. It's that you're already running equally powerful patterns of your own.

You just can't see them because they're YOUR defaults.

What's below: The Pattern Detector Prompt that reveals YOUR invisible persuasion patterns from any recording of yourself speaking.

One discovered pattern could be worth $1,000s in your next sale, $50,000 in your next launch, or the difference between being forgotten and unforgettable. (Yes, I just used Brunson's Value Anchor on you…stating value before revealing what you get.)

For less than what you spent on lunch today, you'll discover the psychological patterns you're already using unconsciously. The ones that make people lean in when you talk, that close deals without feeling salesy, that you can't see because they're as natural as breathing.

Stop copying Brunson's patterns when you already have million-dollar patterns of your own. You just need to see them.

(And yes, I just used the Status Flip, positioning you as already having something valuable. See how these patterns work even when you know they're happening?)

Just $10 to discover what's been invisible your whole life.
