### Angle Multiplication

Same insight, different entry points:

**The Stradivarius Story → Multiple Angles:**

| Angle | Hook | Audience |
|-------|------|----------|
| Legacy | "Your Best Work Is Dying With You" | Experts worried about impact |
| Business | "Why Your Expertise Isn't Making You Money" | Consultants, coaches |
| AI | "What AI Can't Extract From Your Brain" | Tech-forward audience |
| Teaching | "Why Your Best Students Can't Replicate You" | Educators, trainers |
| Leadership | "The Knowledge That Dies When Your Best People Leave" | Managers, executives |

### Format Adaptation Rules

**Long-form → Short-form:**

1. Extract the single strongest insight

2. Remove all context/buildup

3. Front-load the payoff

4. Add pattern interrupt if needed for platform

**Written → Video:**

1. Simplify sentence structure

2. Add verbal emphasis cues

3. Break into visual beats

4. Script the energy (where to punch, where to pause)

**Solo → Carousel:**

1. One idea per slide

2. First slide = hook (standalone scroll-stopper)

3. Build tension across slides

4. Last slide = payoff + CTA
