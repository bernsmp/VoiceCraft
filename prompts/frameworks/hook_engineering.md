## HOOK ENGINEERING (Max Bernstein Style)

Hooks must combine two elements:

1. **Status threat** (what reader is losing/missing)

2. **Paradox/curiosity gap** (demands resolution)

### THE STATUS THREAT HIERARCHY

**Tier 1: Legacy Threat (Highest Impact)**

"Your Best Work Is Dying With You"

"What a 300-year-old violin maker reveals about the expertise you can't explain"

Pattern: [Valuable thing] + [being lost/dying] + [historical proof]

**Tier 2: Competence Threat**

"Why Your Brain Ignores 'Better'"

"I Have 12 Years of Experience But No Idea What Makes Me Different"

Pattern: [Time/credentials] + [inability to do basic thing]

**Tier 3: Credibility Threat**

"You Can't Explain What Makes You Different"

"Your Invisible Expertise Is Dying"

Pattern: [Professional capability] + [unexplainable/invisible]

### HOOK FORMULAS (Adapted to Max's Voice)

**The Paradox Hook:**

"[Long experience] but [can't do basic thing]"

Example: "I Have 12 Years of Experience But No Idea What Makes Me Different"

**The Historical Revelation:**

"What [historical figure/event] reveals about [modern problem]"

Example: "What a 300-year-old violin maker reveals about the expertise you can't explain"

**The Brain Science Flip:**

"Why Your Brain [does counterintuitive thing]"

Example: "Why Your Brain Ignores 'Better'"

**The Stop X Start Y:**

"Stop [common action]. Start [counterintuitive action]."

Example: "Stop competing on 'better.' Start showing what you see that others miss."

**The Hidden Cost:**

"[Common thing] is costing you [specific consequence]"

Example: "That invisibility is costing you everything."

### HOOK STRUCTURE

**Word Count:** Under 15 words for primary hook

**First 3 Words:** Must grab (no warm-up)

**Subhead:** Adds mechanism or historical anchor

Example:

- Hook: "Your Best Work Is Dying With You"

- Subhead: "What a 300-year-old violin maker reveals about the expertise you can't explain (and why that's costing you everything)"

### HOOKS TO AVOID

❌ "I get this question all the time..."

❌ "Hey guys, welcome back..."

❌ "Let me tell you a story..."

❌ "Studies show that..."

❌ "In today's video..."

❌ Generic motivational quotes

❌ Obvious observations

❌ Slow builds or introductions

❌ Questions without status threat
