## INPUT PROCESSING PROTOCOLS

Different input types require different extraction approaches.

---

### Input Type: Voice Note

**Characteristics:**

- Raw, unstructured

- Energy/emotion visible in delivery

- Contains tangents and verbal tics

- Real language patterns

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Energy Mapping**

   - Where does energy peak? (excitement, frustration, emphasis)

   - What phrases get repeated?

   - Where does speaker speed up/slow down?

2. **Gold Extraction**

   - Quotable phrases (preserve exact wording)

   - Story seeds (anecdotes mentioned in passing)

   - Insight drops (moments of clarity)

3. **Structure Detection**

   - What's the core point buried in rambling?

   - What examples did they give naturally?

   - What would they say if they had 30 seconds?

**Output Focus:** Preserve energy and exact phrases. Don't over-polish.

### Input Type: Transcript (Interview/Call)

**Characteristics:**

- Multiple speakers

- Q&A structure

- Longer form

- Contains both filler and gold

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Speaker Dynamics**

   - Who drives insight? (not always the "expert")

   - Where do interesting tensions appear?

   - What questions sparked best answers?

2. **Moment Mining**

   - Find the 3-5 "quotable" moments

   - Identify transformation arcs

   - Extract frameworks mentioned but not named

3. **Multi-Angle Development**

   - Same transcript → multiple content pieces

   - Each angle = different hook/audience

**Output Focus:** Extract multiple pieces, not just one.

### Input Type: Raw Idea / Daily Moment

**Characteristics:**

- Brief, unformed

- Needs significance amplification

- Contains seed, not full story

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Significance Amplification**

   - Why does this matter beyond this moment?

   - What universal truth does it reveal?

   - Who else experiences this?

2. **Story Expansion**

   - What happened before/after?

   - What's the concrete scene?

   - What sensory details bring it alive?

3. **Framework Connection**

   - Does this illustrate an existing framework?

   - Does this reveal a new pattern?

   - How does this connect to audience's struggles?

**Output Focus:** Expand from seed to full narrative.

### Input Type: Existing Content (for Optimization)

**Characteristics:**

- Already structured

- May have performance data

- Needs diagnosis, not creation

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Performance Diagnosis**

   - What's working? (engagement points)

   - What's not? (drop-off points)

   - Hook strength assessment

2. **Gap Analysis**

   - Missing viral triggers?

   - Weak structure sections?

   - AI patterns present?

3. **Targeted Fixes**

   - Specific improvements, not full rewrite

   - Hook alternatives

   - Structure tightening

**Output Focus:** Surgical improvements with reasoning.

### Input Type: Analytics Data

**Characteristics:**

- Numbers, not narrative

- Reveals patterns across content

- Requires interpretation

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Pattern Recognition**

   - What content types perform best?

   - What hooks consistently work?

   - What's the sweet spot for length/format?

2. **Success Formula Extraction**

   - Commonalities in top performers

   - Differences from underperformers

   - Replicable elements identified

3. **Replication Strategy**

   - Templates based on winners

   - Testing hypotheses for improvement

   - Content calendar recommendations

**Output Focus:** Actionable patterns, not just observations.

### Input Type: Comments/DMs

**Characteristics:**

- Direct audience language

- Pain points revealed

- Questions = content opportunities

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Pain Point Mining**

   - What struggles keep appearing?

   - What questions get asked repeatedly?

   - What language do they use? (mirror it)

2. **Content Opportunity Mapping**

   - Each repeated question = potential piece

   - Each struggle = hook angle

   - Each success story = testimonial content

3. **Direct Response Content**

   - "You asked about X. Here's the answer."

   - Creates connection + authority

   - Natural engagement driver

**Output Focus:** Audience language → content ideas.
