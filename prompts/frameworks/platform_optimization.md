## PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION MATRIX

### TikTok

**Timing:**

- Hook: 0-2 seconds (CRITICAL)

- Pattern interrupt every 8-10 seconds

- Total: 30-60 seconds optimal

**Structure:**

- Front-load value (no buildup)

- Text overlay essential (sound-off viewing)

- End with loop potential or cliffhanger

**Voice Adaptation:**

- Faster pace than written

- More direct ("Here's the thing" → just state the thing faster)

- Energy higher, pauses shorter

**What Works:**

- Trending audio integration

- Native effects

- Face-to-camera with text overlay

- "POV:" format

- Before/after reveals

**What Fails:**

- Slow intros

- Text-only without visual movement

- Overly polished/corporate feel

- No hook in first 2 seconds

---

### Instagram Reels

**Timing:**

- Hook: 0-3 seconds

- Total: 30-90 seconds

**Structure:**

- First frame must work as static image (grid thumbnail)

- Aesthetic consistency with feed

- Save-triggering value (frameworks, lists)

**Voice Adaptation:**

- Slightly more polished than TikTok

- Can handle slightly longer sentences

- Aesthetic alignment matters

**What Works:**

- Bold text overlays

- Clean, minimal design

- Carousels for frameworks

- Story reshare optimization

**What Fails:**

- Messy visuals

- No text overlay

- TikTok watermarks

- Inconsistent aesthetic

### YouTube Shorts

**Timing:**

- Hook: 0-5 seconds (slightly more room)

- Total: 30-60 seconds

**Structure:**

- Clear value proposition upfront

- Can handle slightly more complexity

- End screen consideration (subscribe momentum)

- Series potential

**Voice Adaptation:**

- Slightly slower than TikTok

- More explanation allowed

- Title reinforcement in video

**What Works:**

- Educational depth

- Series content

- Searchable topics

- Clear takeaways

**What Fails:**

- Too fast/TikTok energy

- No clear value proposition

- Ignoring search/SEO potential

---

### LinkedIn

**Timing:**

- Hook: First line visible in feed (under 150 characters)

- Total: 800-1,500 words for articles, 150-300 words for posts

**Structure:**

- Professional angle required

- Data/results focus

- Line breaks for readability

- Strong first line (appears in preview)

**Voice Adaptation:**

- Confident but not preachy

- Specific numbers and outcomes

- Industry language where appropriate

- Business impact emphasis

**What Works:**

- Personal story + business insight

- Counterintuitive professional takes

- Framework reveals

- Before/after transformations with numbers

- "I used to think X. Now I know Y."

**What Fails:**

- Motivational quotes

- Generic advice

- No specific outcomes

- Wall of text

- Humble-bragging without value
