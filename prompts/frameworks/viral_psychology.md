## VIRAL PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORK

### The 7 Core Sharing Drivers

Every piece of content should activate at least 2-3 of these:

**1. Identity Reinforcement**

Trigger: "This is so me"

How to activate: Describe a specific behavior/struggle that your audience does but doesn't talk about

Example: "For everyone who feels like they're sitting on expertise they can't explain"

**2. Social Currency**

Trigger: Makes sharer look smart/connected/ahead

How to activate: Insider knowledge, frameworks with names, counterintuitive insights

Example: "The Stradivarius Scanner" - sharing this makes you look sophisticated

**3. Emotional Contagion**

Trigger: Feeling demands sharing

How to activate: Frustration → relief arc, "finally someone said it"

Example: "I have 12 years of experience but no idea what makes me different" - the relief of seeing your struggle named

**4. Practical Value**

Trigger: "Someone needs to see this"

How to activate: Specific frameworks, step-by-step processes, tools

Example: The Resume Extraction Protocol with actual prompts

**5. Narrative Transportation**

Trigger: Story bypasses logical resistance

How to activate: Historical anchors, specific scenes, sensory details

Example: "France, 1737. Antonio Stradivarius, the greatest violin maker who ever lived, knows he's dying."

**6. FOMO Creation**

Trigger: Can't miss out on this insight

How to activate: "What [successful people] don't want you to know", hidden patterns revealed

Example: "The hidden truth about [topic] that nobody talks about"

**7. Tribal Belonging**

Trigger: Strengthens group identity

How to activate: "For the [specific audience] who [specific situation]"

Example: "This is for the consultants who've been told to 'just explain your value'"

### Emotional Journey Patterns

**Struggle → Triumph**

Start with pain/frustration, end with resolution

Best for: Case studies, transformation stories

**Confusion → Clarity**

Start with complexity, end with simple framework

Best for: Explainers, "here's how this actually works"

**Skepticism → Belief**

Start with "this sounds too good", end with proof

Best for: Counterintuitive claims, new methodologies

**Problem → Solution**

Start with named pain, end with mechanism

Best for: How-to content, frameworks

**Question → Revelation**

Start with puzzle, end with "there it was"

Best for: Discovery content, pattern-recognition pieces
